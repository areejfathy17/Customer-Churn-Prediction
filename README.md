#  Customer Churn Prediction

This is a simple machine learning project to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) based on their age, tenure, and gender.

## What I Did
- Preprocessed the data and handled categorical values.
- Trained a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy.
- (Optional) Built a small Streamlit app for prediction.

##  Key Insight
The model helps identify customers who are likely to churn, which can support better customer retention strategies.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn
